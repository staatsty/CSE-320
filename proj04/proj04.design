Computer Project #4 -- Sequential Circuits

a) Give your name, MSU PID and sequence derived from your MSU PID.

  Name: Tyler Staats

  MSU PID: A51390344

  Derived sequence: A513904
 

b) Complete the following truth tables to describe the Boolean functions which
form the basis for your circuits.  For each function, replace the hyphens with
the appropriate entry (0, 1 or d), where 'd' represents the "don't care"
condition.

d) Give the minimized (simplified) expression for each of the Boolean
functions.
 
   W(w,x,y,z) = yz + xz'
 
   X(w,x,y,z) = x'z'
 
   Y(w,x,y,z) = xz' + w'x'y'z
 
   Z(w,x,y,z) = y + w'z
